Powder-blown laser directed energy deposition (L-DED) expanded the material design space by offering the ability to deposit multiple powder feedstocks simultaneously, enabling the fabrication of functionally graded materials. However, achieving the desired material distribution in multimaterial parts presents challenges due to transient deposition behavior resulting in irregular gradients. Here, we developed a model for precise powder delivery control in a custom L-DED system by tuning multiple powder flow rates to achieve varying alloy gradients and correlating powder flow with feedstock proportions in the printed blend. Powder flow was modeled as a first-order transfer function with an initial delay for powder transport. The proportions of each constituent alloy in the printed blend were interpolated based on the concentration of elements unique to each feedstock, characterized via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. This work provides crucial insights for the design and optimization of complex multimaterial distributions in functionally graded materials for high-performance applications.
